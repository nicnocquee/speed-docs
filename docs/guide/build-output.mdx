title: Build output
---

After running the `speed-docs` CLI tool, you will get a `docs-output` directory. This directory contains your built documentation. You can deploy this directory to any static hosting service.

Currently the generated documentation is based on [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev). So you can expect the following features:

- [Search using Orama static mode](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/headless/search/orama#static-export).
- Responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet and mobile.
- Dark and light mode.
- All built-in [components](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/ui/components) of Fumadocs are supported.
- Code highlighting.

More fumadocs features will be supported.
