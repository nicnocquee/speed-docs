title: Deploy
---

You can deploy your documentation to any static hosting service. After running

```bash
speed-docs <content-directory>
```

your documentation will be built and copied to the `docs-output` directory. You can then deploy the `docs-output` directory to any static hosting service.

## Local preview

If you want to see the built documentation on your computer, you can run:

```bash
npx serve@latest docs-output
```

and open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. Replace the port number with whatever port that `serve` is using.

## Development mode

You can run the CLI in development mode by using the `--dev` option. In this mode, the CLI will watch for changes in your content directory and rebuild the documentation automatically. Any changes will be reflected in the documentation immediately.

```bash
speed-docs <content-directory> --dev
```

Open the website in the URL that is shown in the console.

## GitHub Pages

For convenience, you can deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages by using the [Speed Docs GitHub Action](https://github.com/nicnocquee/speed-docs-github-action).
