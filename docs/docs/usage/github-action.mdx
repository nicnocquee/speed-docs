You can deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages by using the [Speed Docs GitHub Action](https://github.com/nicnocquee/speed-docs-github-action).

## Usage

You can use the following workflow to deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages:

```yaml
name: Deploy Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Pages
        id: setup_pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Deploy docs to GitHub Pages
        uses: nicnocquee/speed-docs-github-action@v1
        with:
          content-path: "./docs" # The path to your content directory
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # This is a secret that GitHub automatically creates for you so you don't need to create it manually
          base-path: ${{ steps.setup_pages.outputs.base_path }} # The base path for your documentation GitHub Pages if you're not using custom domain
```
