title: Welcome to Speed Docs
---

Speed Docs is an open source CLI tool to create online documentation quickly. You just need to write your content in Markdown and define the structure of your documentation. You don't need to waste time building the UI yourself. And if you put your documentation files in the same repository as your project, you won't pollute your project with documentation web app files.

Currently, the template is based on the Next.js version of [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev). But more templates will be supported in the future.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

## Installation

```package-install
npm install -g speed-docs
