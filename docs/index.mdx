title: Welcome to Speed Docs
---

Speed Docs is an open source CLI tool to build and publish online documentation quickly. You just need to write your content in MDX (Markdown) and define the structure of your documentation. After running the CLI, you will get a beautiful and responsive static website like this documentation website!

Using this tool, you don't need to waste time building the UI yourself. You can focus on writing your content and the tool will take care of the rest. If you put your documentation files in the same repository as your project, you won't pollute your project with documentation web app files.

Currently, the template is based on the Next.js version of [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev). But more templates will be supported in the future.
