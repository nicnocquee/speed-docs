You can deploy your documentation to any static hosting service. After running

```bash
speed-docs <origin-directory>
```

your documentation will be built and copied to the `docs-output` directory. You can then deploy the `docs-output` directory to any static hosting service.

## Local preview

If you want to see the built documentation on your computer, you can run:

```bash
npx serve@latest docs-output
```

and open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser. Repalce the port number with whatever port that `serve` is using.

## GitHub Pages

You can deploy your documentation to GitHub Pages by using the [Speed Docs GitHub Action](https://github.com/nicnocquee/speed-docs-github-action).
